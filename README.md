# ExpressionMatrix2
Software for analysis of gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing.

This repository contains software for analysis of gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing developed at Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.

This code is at a prototype, pre-alpha stage. It is hoped that it can be useful in its current form, but it is likely that it contains bugs or other errors that impact its ability to give meaningful results. In addition, a validation of this code has not been performed. This prototype code is released in open source form with an MIT license (see LICENSE.md).
