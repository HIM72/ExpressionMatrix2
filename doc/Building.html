<h1>Building from source</h1>

<p>
You only need to build from source if you have determined
that none of the pre-built configurations
are appropriate for your needs, or if you want to modify,
test, or debug the code. 
If none of the above applies, see 
<a href=GettingStarted.html>here</a>
for detailed information on how to get started quickly.

<p>
A release version of the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> software
comes with pre-built version for the following configurations
for Ubuntu 16 and CentOs 7.

<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
<tr><th>Platform<th>Configuration<br>name<th>Python version<th>HDF5 support
<tr><td>Ubuntu 16<td>Release-ubuntu16-python2<td class=centered>2<td class=centered>Yes
<tr><td>Ubuntu 16<td>Release-ubuntu16-python3<td class=centered>3<td class=centered>Yes
<tr><td>Ubuntu 16<td>Release-ubuntu16-nohdf5-python2<td class=centered>2<td class=centered>No
<tr><td>Ubuntu 16<td>Release-ubuntu16-nohdf5-python3<td class=centered>3<td class=centered>No
<tr><td>CentOS 7<td>Release-centos7-python2<td class=centered>2<td class=centered>Yes
<tr><td>CentOS 7<td>Release-centos7-nohdf5-python2<td class=centered>2<td class=centered>No
</table>

<p>
You can choose the version that is appropriate for you.
HDF5 support is only necessary if you intend to use functions 
<a href=PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html?highlight=hdf5#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromHdf5>
ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromHdf5</a>
or
<a href=PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html?highlight=hdf5#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromBioHub2>
ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromBioHub2</a>.
If you don't need to use these functions, choose one of the versions without HDF5 
support as they have fewer dependencies on installed packages.

<p>
The <code>Release-ubuntu16-nohdf5-python3</code> version can also be used on
Windows 10 via Windows Subsystem for Linux and the Windows Ubuntu application.
See <a href=GettingStartedOnWindows.html>here</a> for more information.

<p>
The <code>Release-ubuntu16-nohdf5-python3</code> version,
because of its minimal set of dependencies,
may also run on Linux platforms other than Ubuntu 16
but running a similar Linux kernel.

<p>
To build the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> software from source,
you can use Eclipse or CMake.


<h2>Obtaining the source code</h2>
<p>
There are a couple of ways to get the source code from GitHub. 
<ul>
<li>From <a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2">top page for the ExpressionMatrix2 repository</a>, click on <code>Clone or Download</code>.
<li> Use the following command: 
<code>git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2</code>.
This requires <code>git</code> to be installed.
</ul>



<h2>Building from source using Eclipse</h2>
<p>
The repository includes at its top level Eclipse files <code>.project</code>
and <code>.cproject</code> which can be used to load 
the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> into Eclipse and build it.
The build settings used in Eclipse are the ones for the 
<code>Release-ubuntu16-python3</code> configuration.
If you need to build with different settings,
you can modify the settings in Eclipse, or use cmake as described below.
A debug version of the same configuration is also provided in Eclipse,
and can be used for debugging.









<br><br><h2>Building using <code>CMake</code></h2>
<p>
The <code>ExpressionMatrix2/src</code> directory contains
file <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> which can be used for 
building using <code>CMake</code>.
This provides some amount of customization that can be used
to build on other Linux platforms. 
To build in this way:

<ul>
<li>
Make sure the prerequisite packages necessary for the
configuration you intend to build are installed.
See <a href=#Prerequisites>here</a> for more information.
<li>
Create a new empty directory to contain the build and <code>cd</code> to it.
This directory can be anywhere - it does not have to
be in the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> source tree.
<li>
Run command <code>cmake .../ExpressionMatrix2/src</code>,
making sure to enter the correct local path for the <code>ExpressionMatrix2/src</code>
directory. 
Also add the CMake <code>-D</code> options appropriate
for the configuration you want to build, as described below.
This will create a <code>Makefile</code>.
<li>
Run command <code>make</code>. 
This will create <code>ExpressionMatrix2.so</code>.
</ul>

<p>
If your build machine has multiple processors and sufficient memory,
you can use the <code>-j</code> option of the <code>make</code> command
to speed up the build. See the <code>man</code> page for 
the <code>make</code> command for more information.


<p>
You can use CMake option <code>-D</code> to override
default values for one or more of the following 
configuration variables:
<table>
<tr><th>Variable<th>Default<br>value<th>Description
<tr><td><code>PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH</code><td><code>/usr/include/python3.5m</code>
<td>The include path for the Python version you want your shared library to work with.
<tr><td><code>PYBIND11_INCLUDE_PATH</code><td><code>/usr/local/include/python3.5</code>
<td>The directory where <code>pybind11</code> include files are installed.
This must be a version of <code>pybind11</code> consistent with the
Python version you want to build for.
<tr><td><code>BUILD_WITH_HDF5</code><td><code>ON</code>
<td>If set to <code>OFF</code>, disables HDF5 functionality
(functions 
<a href=PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html?highlight=hdf5#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromHdf5>
ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromHdf5</a>
or
<a href=PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html?highlight=hdf5#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromBioHub2>
ExpressionMatrix.addCellsFromBioHub2</a>)
and eliminates the dependency on HDF5 include files and libraries.
<tr><td><code>HDF5_INCLUDE_PATH</code><td><code>/usr/include/hdf5/serial</code>
<td>The directory where HDF5 include files are located.
Only used if <code>BUILD_WITH_HDF5</code> is <code>ON</code>.
<tr><td><code>HDF5_LIBRARIES</code><td><code>hdf5_cpp hdf5_serial</code>
<td>The names of the HDF5 libraries to link with.
Only used if <code>BUILD_WITH_HDF5</code> is <code>ON</code>.
If invoking <code>cmake</code> from the <code>bash</code> shell,
enter these names separated by spaces and enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes, like this:
<code>-DHDF5_LIBRARIES='hdf5_cpp hdf5_serial'</code>. 
Using double quotes will not work.
</table>



<p>
For convenience, the table below lists the CMake <code>-D</code>
options used for each of the pre-built configurations.
<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">

<tr><td>Release-ubuntu16-python2

<h2 id=Prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3 id=PrerequisitesForRunning>Prerequisites for running</h3>
<p>
Disregarding standard system libraries that are available on
all Linux systems,
the only prerequisite for running one of the configurations
with HDF5 functionality turned off is Graphviz.
<p>
To run one of the configurations
with HDF5 functionality you also need HDF5 libraries:
<ul>
<li>For Ubuntu 16, you need packages 
<code>libhdf5-10</code> (or <code>libhdf5-10-dev</code>) 
and <code>libhdf5-cpp-11</code>.
<li>For CentOS 7, you need package  
<code>hdf5</code>.
</ul>



<h3>Prerequisites for building from source</h3>

<p>
A small number of prerequisites are necessary to build the 
<code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> code:
<ul>
<li>The Boost libraries, including development files.
<li>A version of Python, including development files.
<li>pybind11, in a version consistent with the Python version to be used.
<li>HDF5 libraries, unless you are building with <code>-DBUILD_WITH_HDF5=OFF</code>.
Package names are 
</ul>
This list does not include prerequisites, such as the <code>gcc</code> compiler,
which are available on most Linux distributions.

For convenience, package names for the above for Ubuntu 16 and CentOS 7
are listed here:

<p><table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
<tr><th>Package<th>Ubuntu 16<th>CentOS 7
<tr><td>Boost libraries<td>libboost-all-dev<td>boost-devel
<tr><td>Python 2<td>python-all-dev<td>python-devel
<tr><td>Python 3<td>python3-all-dev<td>
<tr><td>Pybind11<td>pybind11<td>pybind11
<tr><td>HDF5 libraries<td>libhdf5-dev, libhdf5-cpp-11<td>hdf5-devel
</table>
<p>The <code>pybind11</code> package is installed using (as root)
<code>pip install pybind11</code> for Python 2
and <code>pip3 install pybind11</code> for Python 3.



<h2>Generating documentation for the C++ code</h2>
<p>
Reference documentation for the Python API is
<a href="PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html">here</a>.
<p>
To generate Doxygen documentation for the C++ code,
make sure you have Doxygen installed
(Ubuntu package name is <code>doxygen</code>),
cd to <code>ExpressionMatrix2/doc/doxygen</code>, then issue command 
<code>doxygen</code> without arguments.

Documentation will be created in directory <code>ExpressionMatrix2/doc/doxygen/html</code>. 
The top level file
of the documentation will be <code>ExpressionMatrix2/doc/doxygen/html/index.html</code>.
Point your browser to that to see the documentation.

For readability, the C++ code does not contain
any Doxygen directives, so the generated documentation
will only contain what Doxygen can do with <code>EXTRACT_ALL=YES</code>
and without relying on documentation directives in the code.
Even with this limitation, this can be useful to explore the C++ code.
