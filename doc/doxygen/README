To generate Doxygen documentation for the C++ code,
just make sure you have doxygen installed
(ubuntu package name is "doxygen"),
cd to this directory, then issue command 
"doxygen" without arguments.

Documentation will be created in directory "html"
under this directory. The top level file
of the documentation will be "html/index.html".
Point your browser to that to see the documentation.

For readability, the C++ code does not contain
and Doxygen directives, so the generated documentation
will only contain what Doxygen can do with "EXTRACT_ALL=YES"
and without relying on documentation directives in the code.
Even with this limitation, this can be very useful to explore the C++ code.
