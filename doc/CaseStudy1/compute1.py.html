<h1>Case study 1 script compute1.py</h1>

<p>
This script finds pairs of cells that have similar 
gene expressions, with similarities computed taking all genes
into account.

<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
#!/usr/bin/python3
</pre></div>
<p>
This line allows the script to be called directly from the shell,
<code>
"./compute1.py".
</code>
This assumes that you are on a platform that uses Python 3.
If you are on a platform that uses Python 2, you instead need to 
invoke the script as 
<code>
"python compute1.py".
</code>


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
from ExpressionMatrix2 import *
</pre></div>
<p>
This makes the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> code accessible
from Python, without the need to prefix it with a module name.
This is not necessarily a good idea, particularly for a large script,
but it does simplify the code a bit.
<p>
For this to work, <code>ExpressionMatrix2.so</code> must be located in
a directory where the Python interpreter can find it. 
There are several ways to do that, the simplest of which consists
of simply setting environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
to the name of the directory that contains <code>ExpressionMatrix2.so</code>.


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
# Access our existing expression matrix.
e = ExpressionMatrix(directoryName = 'data')
</pre></div>
<p>
This creates an <code>ExpressionMatrix</code> object using the existing binary files
in the <code>data</code> directory. 
The binary files are memory mapped rather than explicitly read,
so construction of the <code>ExpressionMatrix</code> object
is very fast (almost instantaneous).
<p>
See <a href=../PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.__init__>here</a> 
for reference information on the <code>ExpressionMatrix</code> constructors.


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
# Find pairs of similar cells (approximate computation using LSH, 
# while still looping over all pairs). 
print("Finding pairs of similar cells.")
e.findSimilarPairs3(similarPairsName = 'Lsh')
</pre></div>
<p>
This finds pairs of similar cells using default parameters.
The pairs of similar cells are stored in a named
<i>SimilarPairs</i> object stored in the <code>data</code>
directory. 
We chose the name <code>Lsh</code> as a reminder that these similar pairs
were found using <code>findSimilarPairs3</code>, which
uses Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).
See <a href=../PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.findSimilarPairs3>here</a> 
for reference information on <code>findSimilarPairs3</code>.
<p>
We used default parameters for <code>findSimilarPairs3</code>, which means
that the computation is done for all cells, using similarities
computed taking all genes into account, and storing only pairs 
for which the similarity is at least 0.2.
The maximum number of similar cells that are stored for each cell is limited
to the default value of 100. This means that, if there are more than
100 cells with similarity greater than 0.2 for a given cell,
only the 100 with the greatest similarity are stored.
<p>
Using the default parameters also means that 1024 LSH hyperplanes
are used. With 1024 hyperplanes, the computation of similarity
using LSH has a standard deviation of 0.05 or better
from the exact similarity value (regression coefficient of expression vectors).
