<h1>Case study 1 script input.py</h1>

<p>
This script initializes the expression matrix from
the data in the input files. 

<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
#!/usr/bin/python3
</pre></div>
<p>
This line allows the script to be called directly from the shell,
<code>
"./input.py".
</code>
This assumes that you are on a platform that uses Python 3.
If you are on a platform that uses Python 2, you instead need to 
invoke the script as 
<code>
"python input.py".
</code>


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
from ExpressionMatrix2 import *
</pre></div>
<p>
This makes the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> code accessible
from Python, without the need to prefix it with a module name.
This is not necessarily a good idea, particularly for a large script,
but it does simplify the code a bit.
<p>
For this to work, <code>ExpressionMatrix2.so</code> must be located in
a directory where the Python interpreter can find it. 
There are several ways to do that, the simplest of which consists
of simply setting environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
to the name of the directory that contains <code>ExpressionMatrix2.so</code>.


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
# Create a new, empty expression matrix.
# The data directory must not exist.
e = ExpressionMatrix(
    directoryName = 'data', 
    geneCapacity = 100000,
    cellCapacity = 10000,
    cellMetaDataNameCapacity = 10000,
    cellMetaDataValueCapacity = 1000000
    )
</pre></div>
<p>
This creates the new <code>ExpressionMatrix</code> object which,
at this point, is empty (that is, it does not contain any genes or cells).
The specified directory name must not exists, and is used
to store all subsequent data structures needed for this 
<code>ExpressionMatrix</code> object.
<p>
The four capacity arguments control the capacity of various
hash tables used to store genes names, cell names, 
and cell meta names and values. 
To avoid performance degradation in the hash tables, make sure to 
set the capacities to at least a factor of two greater
that what you think you will need. 
There is currently no automatic rehashing of the tables,
so if one of the capacities is exceeded the run will have to
be restarted from scratch with larger capacities.

See <a href=../PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.__init__>here</a> for reference information on
the <code>ExpressionMatrix</code> constructors.


<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
# Add the cells.
e.addCells(
    expressionCountsFileName = 'GBM_raw_gene_counts.csv',
    expressionCountsFileSeparators = ' ', 
    cellMetaDataFileName = 'GBM_metadata.csv',
    cellMetaDataFileSeparators = ' ' 
    )
</pre></div>
<p>
This causes the expression data and the cell meta data contained
in the input files to be stored in the <code>ExpressionMatrix</code>
object (that is, in binary files in the <code>data</code> directory).
See 
<a href=../PythonApi.html#addCells>here</a> 
for more information on the 
<a href=../PythonApiReference/_build/html/index.html#ExpressionMatrix2.ExpressionMatrix.addCells><code>addCells</code></a> call.

<div class=codeSnippet><pre>
<pre>
print('Input completed.')
</pre></div>
<p>
Self-explanatory.
