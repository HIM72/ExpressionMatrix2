<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>
Use the following directions to quickly get started and run ExpressionMatrix2 on a toy dataset distributed as part of the repository.

<ul>

<li>
Use a Linux machine running Ubuntu 16.04 (the current long term support release of Ubuntu). Other distributions using similar versions of the Linux kernel, such as Linux Mint 18, will also work.

<li>
Make sure the following packages, all available from the standard Ubuntu repositories, are installed:
<ul>
<li>The Boost libraries (package libboost-all-dev).
<li>Python3 (package python3-all-dev).
<li>Graphviz (package graphviz). 
<li>Libraries needed to read HDF5 files (packages libhdf5-10 and libhdf5-cpp-11).
</ul>
If one or more of these packages are not installed, you can install them using command "apt install packageName", where packageName is as indicated above. This requires root access.

<li>
Make a local copy of this GitHub repository, chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2. An easy way to so this is to click on the green button "Clone or download" on the top right of the GitHub page for this repository, click on "Download ZIP", then expand the zip file.

<li>
Make a copy of the test directory tests/ToyTest1. It contains csv files with a sample expression matrix and cell meta data for a small toy test with just 3 cells and 3 genes. It also contains two small python scripts.

<li>
To run the test, you need to select one of the versions of shared library ExpressionMatrix2.so stored in the bin/ubuntu-16.04 directory of the repository. Each of the versions resides in a directory named after the date when that version was created. If you are unsure which one to use, pick the most recent. Make a copy of the selected version of ExpressionMatrix.so in the copy of the test directory you created in the previous item.

<li>
In your copy of the test directory, run command "./run.py". This will read the csv files and create binary data structures stored in mapped files in a new directory named data.

<li>
Run command "./runServer.py". This starts the ExpressionMatrix2 code in a mode where if behaves as an http server that can be used for interactive visualization and analysis. This command continues running until you interrupt it.

<li>
While the server is running, start a web browser on the same machine, and point it to the following URL: http://localhost:17100.

<li>
Interactively explore the functionality offered by the server. You will need a more real test case to perform any interesting visualization or analysis, but if you made it here you are ready to run the ExpressionMatrix2 software on real data. 

</ul>

<p>
Note that to simplify the "Getting started" process we copied ExpressionMatrix2.so to the same directory containing the Python scripts, so it is found automatically. In real use, this will not be practical, and instead you will want to set environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory containing ExpressionMatrix2.so. This will allow the Python interpreter to locate it. 

<p>
You can finds more detailed documentation in the doc directory of the local copy of the repository you created. You can point your browser to doc/index.html to get started.
