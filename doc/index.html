<h1>Documentation for GitHub repository chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2</h1>

<p>
This repository contains software for analysis of gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing developed at <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com">Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative</a>.

<p>
This code is at a prototype, pre-alpha stage. It is hoped that it can be useful in its current form, but it is likely that it contains bugs or other errors or limitations that impact its ability to give meaningful results. In addition, a validation of this code has not been performed. This prototype code is released in open source form with an <a href=LICENSE.html>MIT license</a>.

<br>
Information useful if you plan to use the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code>
Python API. This allows you to invoke 
<code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> functionality from Python code.

<p>
<a href=Building.html>Building from source</a>
<br>
Explains how to build the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code>
software from source code. For most applications you
will not need to do this, and you can instead use
pre-built code from a published release 
<a href=https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2/releases>available from GitHub</a>.

<p>
<a href=Programming.html>Programming notes</a>
<br>
Information that could be useful if you plan to study
or modify the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> C++ code.

<p>
<a href=CaseStudy1/index.html>Case study 1</a>
<br>
Illustrates use of the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> software
on a real life single-cell RNA sequencing data set.

<p><a href=LshSlides-Nov2017.pdf>LSH slides</a>
<br>
This presentation describes the computational techniques, based on
Locality Sensitive Hashing, than enable
scaling up to large numbers of cells.
