To generate the reference information of the Python API:

- Make sure PYTHONPATH points to the Release-ubuntu16-python3 directory
  and that ExpressionMatrix2.so in that directory is up to date
  (the documentation is obtained from the Python docstrings in 
  ExpressionMatrix2.so).
- From this directory, do "make clean", followed by "make html".
- The html files are created under _build/html.
