<h1>Getting started on CentOS 7</h1>

<p>
Use the following directions to quickly get started and run on CentOS 7 the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> 
software on a toy dataset distributed as part of the repository.

<ul>

<li>
Make sure the following package, available from the CentOS software manager 
in its default settings, is installed:
<ul>
<li>Graphviz (package <code>graphviz</code>). 
</ul>


<li>Select one of the 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2/releases'>releases available on GitHub</a> 
and download the tar file for the release you selected. 
The information in this page applies to release 0.4.0 or later, and
the commands below assume that you selected release 0.4.0.
In that case the tar file will be named 
<a href=https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/ExpressionMatrix2/releases/download/0.4.0/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0.tar><code>ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0.tar</code></a>.

<li>Create an empty directory. 
In the rest of these directions we assume that the directory you created 
is <code>~/ExpressionMatrix2</code>. 
If you use a different name, make sure to use the correct name 
instead of the one used in the rest of these directions.

<li> Move the tar file you downloaded from the directory 
where your browser stores downloads (usually <code>~/Downloads</code>) 
to the <code>~/ExpressionMatrix2</code> directory your just created, 
then <code>cd</code> to <code>~/ExpressionMatrix2</code>.

<li>Extract the files contained in the tar file you downloaded 
using command <code>tar -xvf ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0.tar</code>. 
This will create a new directory 
<code>~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0</code>
containing a <code>doc</code> directory, a <code>test</code> directory, 
and a <code>build</code> directory containing 
<code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> shared libraries for various platforms.

<li>To get started on CentOS 7 in the simplest mode of operation,
you will use shared library 
<code>~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/build/Release-centos7-nohdf5-python2/ExpressionMatrix2.so</code>.
To make this shared library visible as a Python package, 
set environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to
<code>~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/build/Release-centos7-nohdf5-python2</code>. 
In the <code>bash</code> shell, you can do this using command
<code>export PYTHONPATH=~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/build/Release-centos7-nohdf5-python2</code>.

<li>Now <code>cd</code> to test directory 
<code>~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/tests/ToyTest1</code>. 
It contains input files with a sample expression matrix 
and cell meta data for a small toy test with just 3 cells and 3 genes. 
It also contains two small python scripts. 

<li>
Run command <code>python run.py</code>. 

<li>
Run command <code>python runServer.py</code>. 
This starts the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> code in a mode 
where if behaves as an http server that can be used 
for interactive visualization and analysis. This command continues running until you interrupt it.

<li>
While the server is running, start a web browser on the same machine, and point it to the following URL: 
<a>http://localhost:17100</a>.

<li>
Interactively explore the functionality offered by the server. 
You will need a more real test case to perform any interesting visualization or analysis, 
but if you made it here you are ready to run the <code>ExpressionMatrix2</code> software on real data. 
See <a href=index.html>here</a> for more information.

</ul>

<p>
For convenience, the list below summarizes the commands to run.
This assumes that you start in directory <code>~/ExpressionMatrix2</code>
containing the tar file <code><code>ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0.tar</code>:

<p>
<code>
tar -xvf ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0.tar
<br>cd ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/tests/ToyTest1
<br>export PYTHONPATH=~/ExpressionMatrix2/ExpressionMatrix2-0.4.0/build/Release-centos7-nohdf5-python2
<br>python run.py
<br>python runServer.py
</code>
